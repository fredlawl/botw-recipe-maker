# BOTW Recipe Guide

Enter your inventory amounts, and the app will automatically begin calculating
what recipes are available to you to make!

Great for not knowing what to optimally make during master sword quest in
between levels.

> NOTE: This is a serious personal project for me to not only learn React,
but to also build something useful with this practice project.

> NOTE: This is still under development. Sofar the app doesn't really do
anything other than keep track of your inventory amounts--and even that is
incomplete.
